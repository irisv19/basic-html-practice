   <h1>Soccer</h1>
    <p><strong>I've been playing soccer since I was seven. It was the first sport I ever played.</strong></p>

    <h2>How it started</h2>
    <p>Growing up I tried out for every sport my school offered including league teams. I made every team I tried out for, even if I wasn't the best at it.</p> 
    <p>I tried out for</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Soccer</li>
        <li>Softball</li>
        <li>Vollyball</li>
        <li>Cross country</li>
        <li>Basketball</li>
        <li>Tumbling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As I got older doing multiple sports at once was harder and I knew eventually I had to pick one. When it came down to it I stuck with soccer, at first it was less of a choice and more of what I just ended up doing but now, I can't imagine myself not playing. Now that I'm in highschool the teams are more competative and I have to work twice as hard off season than on season just to stay in shape and keep my skills.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>Staying motivated is a huge struggle I think for all athletes, no matter how much you love the sport sometimes you just get really down and think about not doing it. I struggle with it ever once in awhile but its been more appearant lately with tryouts coming up in a few months and the struggles with my team that I had last year. This year a lot of girls are trying out and I feel like I'm out of practice so from now till my tryouts I have been practicing the basics and going out with my old teamates and getting in some running and drills to better prepare myself.</p>
    <h4>My Positions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Starting out I played goalie</li>
        <li>Than right and middle defense</li>
        <li>I made my way up to left or right winger (midfield)</li>
        <li>Now I'm a striker or a forward</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I slowly made my way up the field of positions. Now my job is too keep the ball on the opposing teams side and score the ball into the net. The feeling of making a goal and everyone cheering for you is amazing but <strong>the preasure is on.</strong></p>
    <h4> What I enjoy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cleat shopping</li>
        <li>Picking jearsy numbers</li>
        <li>New jearsys</li>
        <li>Nice fields</li>
        <li>Making a goal</li>
        <li>Away games</li>
        <li>Bus rides with teamates</li>
    </ul>
